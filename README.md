### Welcome to my page. 

I'm a Rising Senior at New York University studying Computer and Data Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. 

I am focused on Anomaly detection for Cybersecurity using unsupervised & deep learning techniques. This includes automated malware detection, NIDS and network anomaly detection, as well as active authentication and UEBA. 

I will at some point try to make an open source, cloud native, anomaly detection application for network security.
