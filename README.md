### Welcome to my page. 

I'm a Junior at New York University studying Computer and Data Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. 

I'm currently working on a C++ Student Information System (SIS) backend which can be found below. It is in the early iterations at the moment. 

My main learning focuses for short term are backends with C++, data colleciton & analysis with python, and increasing my knowledge of computer networks. 

You can reach me at my email! - diego.lopez@nyu.edu - all inquiries are welcome.
