### Welcome to my page. 

I'm a Junior at New York University studying Computer and Data Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. 

I'm currently working on a C++ Student Information System (SIS) backend which can be found below. It is in the early iterations at the moment. 

My main learning focuses for short term are mastery of C++ primary for backend development, data analysis and visualizzation with python packages, as well as NSM tools such as snort, Netsniff-ng, wireshark/tshark and PRADS. 

You can reach me at my email! - diego.lopez@nyu.edu - all inquiries are welcome.
