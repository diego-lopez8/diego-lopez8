### Welcome to my page. 

I'm a Junior at New York University studying Computer and Data Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. 

Current focuses are music intelligence, ethical hacking, and deep learning for cybersecurity. 

Specifically,

I'm currently researching and developing a emotion-based music recommender system (MRS) that is enhanced by cognitive psychology and personality theory. 

I am also exploring ML/DL for cybersecurity, and applying algorithms to network traffic for classification and IDS.

My last main focus is on ethical hacking, and am currently training my skills before moving to bug bounties in the near future.
